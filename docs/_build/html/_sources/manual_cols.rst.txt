# Manually adding a field to `columns.json`
Rather than relying on the autogenerated `columns.json` file, we can manually update it e.g. to add a particular column.

For example, to add `1558` (alcohol intake frequency), open `columns.json` and add:

```
{
    # ...

    "1558-0.0":{},

    # ...
}
```

Then after running `python filterUKB.py...` your output CSV will have a column that looks like this:

| AlcoholIntakFrequenc       |
|----------------------------|
| Three or four times a week |
| Special occasions only     |
| One to three times a month |
| One to three times a month |
| Daily or almost daily      |
| Never                      |
| ...                        |
