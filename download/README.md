# download

To download or process aspects of the dataset:  
	- download_participant_data contains details on downloading participant information, principally that collected during UK Biobank assessment centres (or online questionnaires). 
	- download_accelerometer_data contains details on downloading accelerometer data. This is a bulk dataset and requires particular care to download. It is very rarely necessary to do this fresh: it is more normal to reprocess the files already stored on the rescomp system. 
	- download_health_data contains details on downloading Health Episode Statistics data. 
	
A UK Biobank dataset is associated with a numbered application and, within that application, a numbered copy (this is so subsequent additions of variables to the same application can be distinguished). It is important that the application number is consistent throughout the data downloading and preparation - different applications have a different set of participant IDs, making it impossible to combine them (unless linkage is specifically arranged with UK Biobank). We work or collaborate on several different numbered applications, but this download folder *assumes you are working with [Aiden's 59070 application](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/2020/04/statistical-machine-learning-of-wearable-sensor-data-to-predict-disease-outcomes) *. The main copy associated with this application has the number 41733.
